Making the end effector of an RR Robotic arm follow the blue trajectory as shown below,

Such that the swing phase takes 80%, and the supporting phase (stance) takes 20% of the total time T. The suitable values of h, S, base joint height, and T are taken to generate the given end- effector trajectory. Also, a smooth change in acceleration at any point of the trajectory is maintained. The final answer is shown using matplotlib. 

On launching the python file, a gif and a video of the simulation will be created and the mp4 file would be opened on creation.
